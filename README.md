## Overview

This application simulates a blog that consumes data from the GitHub Users API, GitHub Issues API, and GitHub Search API. The posts are based on the issues of a GitHub repository, allowing users to view a list with the title, summary, and date. By clicking on a post, users are redirected to a detailed page where the content is rendered in Markdown.

The application also displays information from my GitHub profile, such as profile picture, name, bio, follower count, and other data provided by the API.

During development, I practiced key concepts such as:
- API consumption using Axios
- Routing with React Router DOM
- Handling forms
- Component organization and React best practices
